## Submission

You can submit your work through a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository.

The code must be available to us in order to evaluate your submission.

## Evaluation

Our goal is to find answers to these questions:

- Can you set up a project from scratch ? (methodologies / tools / maintainability of the code are aspects that we will take much
into consideration).
- Can you design a REST api that is conform with the standard and easy to use
- Can your write code that is clean, readable and efficent?
